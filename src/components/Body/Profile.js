      <h3>Who am I?</h3>
      <p>I'm a frontend developer and also a mother of two girls.
      Coming from Japan and living in Stockholm/Sweden now. I started my career as Administrator (customer support, office support) / DTP operator in Japan, and then decided to change careers towards IT.
      <br />
      Here, I took a two-year "frontend development" education course at a Swedish Vocatilnal Education School (Nackademin Yrkesh√∂gskola), and after my graduation in May 2018, am looking for an opportunity in Stockholm.
      <br />
      I enjoy solving problems and love coding. 
      I am passionate about what I do, keen on what I am interested in, and work hard for it. I take on challenges to improve myself.
